<h3><b>Description and Topics</b></h3>


The growing demand for energy that will come from developing countries is unavoidable. Therefore, sustainability and efficacy are important, taking into consideration the known finite resources of the earth. Energy efficiency and resource management play a substantial role in achieving the necessary sustainable development. In reality, in the planning, operation, and control of energy systems, effective energy optimization approaches are highly important.

Scope and Topics

This special session is a follow-up to the previous editions of the CEC. Papers on the application of the EC to real-world problems in the field of energy are welcome. Problems may be based in various areas of the energy chain (e.g. heating, cooling and power supply) and different market levels (e.g. household or industrial level). Problems of high complexity under uncertainty, dynamic objective settings, many-objectives, and large-scale search spaces are more than welcome. This special session aims to bridge the gap between energy engineers and the new EC applications for energy optimization problems. In addition, this particular session is related to the “Smart Grid Optimization Problems” competition. Participants are also welcome to send the results of their algorithms competition to our session.

Topics should concern EC applications or theory in the energy domain including, but not limited to:

Distributed evolutionary approaches in the energy domain
Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles
Electricity markets
Energy scheduling
Heat and electricity joint optimization problems
Hydrogen economy problems
Multi/many-objective problems in the energy domain
Natural gas optimization problems
Optimal power flow in distribution and transmission
Residential, industrial and district cooling/heating problems
Smart grid and micro-grid problems
Solar and wind power integration and forecast
Super grids problems (continental and transcontinental transmission system)
Transportation & energy joint problems
