<h3><b>Description and Topics</b></h3>

The aim of this special session is to explore the application of computational methods for performance improvement of power system networks and the electrical grid. The advances in technology provide more accurate and fast algorithms. Some of these new algorithms have emerged in the context of artificial intelligence, giving place to a line of research called evolutionary computation. The so-called evolutionary algorithms are mostly nature inspired and are competent enough to face most of the tasks in the new complex paradigm of power and energy systems. The electrical grid has now become smart and has bidirectional communication of information through smart devices. This has motivated the researchers towards the pursuit of solutions to problems with high-dimensionality and huge information. As can be seen, there are many aspects involved in this
context and a detailed examination is required for sustainability and efficient performance. In addition, the complexity of such systems needs to be handled for the benefit of customers. This has affected the energy market equally. Thus, technological advancement should be properly met by price adjustments and profits and considering how the electricity market is affected by forecasting accuracy. This leads to machine learning and deep learning based forecasting methods, which are more adaptive and responsive. All these considerations are expected to increase the benefits and reduce unnecessary monetary losses.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Energy market price forecasting
Forecasting methods and its impact on energy management
Load forecasting using AI/ML/DL.
Optimization for smart grid and electricity market.
Computational intelligence for power system protection
Computation intelligence for smart grid
Planning and operation of grid resources
Smart grid and renewables utilization
Distributed generation and energy price
Energy market scenario and distribution system planning
Smart-grid and optimization
Energy market and renewables
Flexibility resources in the distribution level
Aggregator-DSO-TSO coordination in smart grids
