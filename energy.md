<h3><b>Description and Topics</b></h3>


Keeping the world at current pace in what concerns energy demand is not possible with the limited world resources. Sustainability and efficiency are a crucial part of the process to enable this sustained growth. Moreover, adequate methods of energy optimization are highly relevant in the current paradigm playing a key role in the planning, operation, and control of energy systems. However, several optimization problems in the energy domain are complex by nature since they are highly constrained and face issues related to high-dimensionality, lack of information, noisy and corrupted data as well as real-time requirements. Under these circumstances, achieving good solutions in a reasonable amount of time remains a challenge in most problems. Even the most sophisticated exact solutions require workarounds that often lead to unsatisfactory performance and applicability of the algorithms. Due to the difficulties of traditional algorithms to find feasible solutions for those complex problems in real-world conditions, Evolutionary Computation (EC) has emerged and demonstrated satisfactory performance in a wide variety of applications in the energy domain.

This is a follow-up of the previous special session in WCCI2018. Research work is welcome concerning complex real-world applications of EC in the energy domain. The problems can be focused on different parts of the energy chain (e.g., heating, cooling, and electricity supply) and different consumer targets (e.g., residential or industrial level). Problems dealing with uncertainty, dynamic environments, many-objectives, and large-scale search spaces are important for the scope of this special session. This special session aims at bringing together the latest applications of EC to complex optimization problems in the energy domain. Besides, this special session is linked to the competition on “Evolutionary Computation in Uncertain Environments: A Smart Grid Application”. Therefore, participants are also welcome to submit the results of their algorithm to our session.

Topics must be related to EC in the energy domain including, but not limited to:
- Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles
- Electricity markets
- Energy scheduling
- Heat and electricity joint optimization problems
- Hydrogen economy problems
- Multi/many-objective problems in the energy domain
- Natural gas optimization problems
- Optimal power flow in distribution and transmission
- Residential, industrial and district cooling/heating problems
- Smart grid and micro-grid problems
- Solar and wind power integration and forecast
- Super grids problems (continental and trans-continental transmission system) - Transportation & energy joint problems
- Distributed evolutionary approaches in the energy domain
