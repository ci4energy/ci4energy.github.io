<h3><b>Description and Topics</b></h3>

Sustainability is of significant importance due to increasing demands and limited resources worldwide. In particular, in the field of energy production and consumption, methods are required that allow to phase generation and load efficiently. The vast extension of renewable and distributed energy sources and the growing information infrastructure enable a fine screening of producers and consumers but require the development of tools for the analysis and understanding of large datasets about the energy grid. Key technologies in future ecological, economical and reliable energy systems are energy prediction of renewable resources, prediction of consumption as well as efficient planning and control strategies for network stability.

To enable financially and ecologically viable projects, optimization methods have taken over a key role for planning, optimizing and forecasting sustainable systems. Typically, these approaches make use of domain knowledge in order to achieve the required goal. Even in the case that explicit domain knowledge is not available, specialized methods can also handle large raw numerical sensory data directly, process them, generate reliable and just-in-time responses, and have high fault tolerance.

<h3><b>Scope and Topics</b></h3>

Following the success of the previous edition at GECCO2017 “Workshop on Evolutionary Algorithms for Smart Grids (SmartEA)” (http://ci4energy.uni-paderborn.de/smartEA/), the main goal of this workshop is to promote the research on evolutionary algorithms in smart grids. We are seeking innovative research articles including, but not limited to the following areas:

- Energy generation and load forecasting
- Demand side and smart home energy management
- Network Restoration
- Real-time control and optimization
- Smart micro-grids

Submitted work should put an emphasis on modeling of solution spaces, on finding optimal representations and operators for evolutionary algorithms, and on employing and developing advanced evolutionary heuristics, e.g., for step size control, constraint handling, dynamic solution spaces, and multiple conflictive objectives.

<h3><b>Important Dates</b></h3>

These dates are strict, no extensions will be granted

- Submission opening: February 27, 2019

Workshop papers must be submitted using the GECCO submission site. After login, the authors need to select the "Workshop Paper" submission form. In the form, the authors must select the workshop they are submitting to. To see a sample of the "Workshop Paper" submission form go to GECCO's submission site and chose "Sample Submission Forms".

Submitted papers must not exceed 8 pages (excluding references) and are required to be in compliance with the GECCO 2019 Papers Submission Instructions. It is recommended to use the same templates as the papers submitted to the main tracks. It is not required to remove the author information if the workshop the paper is submitted to does not have a double-blind review process (please, check the workshop description or the workshop organizers on this).

All accepted papers will be presented at the corresponding workshop and appear in the GECCO Conference Companion Proceedings. By submitting a paper, the author(s) agree that, if their paper is accepted, they will:

Submit a final, revised, camera-ready version to the publisher on or before the camera-ready deadline
Register at least one author before April 24, 2019 to attend the conference
Attend the conference (at least one author)
Present the accepted paper at the conference
